The raw video material needs to be processed in the following manner:
  - concatenated to single video file
  - reduced framerate to 30 (without slowdown, drop half the frames)
  - limited to 1000 frames
  - scaled to 16:9 ratio
  - reduced to 8bit depth
  - downscaled copies to 1920x1080 and 1280x720
  - converted copies to RGB24
