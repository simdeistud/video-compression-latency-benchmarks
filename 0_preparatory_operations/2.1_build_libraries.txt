# How to build libjpeg on Windows
1. Ensure you’ve checked the item "Desktop development with C++" in the
   Workloads tab of Visual Studio Installer.
   Open the Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019-2022, change to the
   source directory and execute the command line
	nmake /f makefile.vs setup-v16
   This will move jconfig.vc to jconfig.h and makefiles to project files.
   (Note that the renaming is critical!)
   Alternatively you can use
	nmake /f makefile.vs setupcopy-v16
   This will create renamed copies of the files,
   which allows to repeat the setup later.
2. Open the solution file jpeg.sln, build the library project.
     a) If you are using Visual Studio more recent than
	2022 version 17, you'll possibly get a message
	saying that the project files are being updated.
     b) If necessary, open the project properties and adapt the
	Windows Target Platform Version (or Windows SDK Version)
	in the Configuration Properties, General section.
     c) If you get a warning saying that a platform cannot be found,
	you can either
	  * forgo the platform and ignore the warning, or
	  * remove the platform in the Configuration Manager, or
	  * install the corresponding platform build tools in
	    Visual Studio Installer (Workloads tab Optional components
	    or Individual components tab).
     d) If you want to build x64 code, change the platform setting from
	Win32 to x64.  You can build Win32 and x64 versions side by side.
     e) If you want to build ARM/ARM64/ARM64EC code, change the platform
	setting to ARM/ARM64/ARM64EC.  Ensure you’ve installed the
	ARM/ARM64/ARM64EC build tools in Visual Studio Installer
	(Workloads tab Optional components or Individual components tab).
	You can build Win32/x64/ARM/ARM64/ARM64EC versions side by side.
3. Open the solution file apps.sln, build the application projects.
4. To perform the self-test, execute the command line
	nmake /f makefile.vs test-32
   for the Win32 build, or on a 64-bit system
	nmake /f makefile.vs test-64
   for the x64 build.
   Note: test options for ARM code will be added
   as soon as Windows on ARM reference devices are available.
   To date there are no Windows on ARM reference devices available.
5. Move the application .exe files from the Release folder to an
   appropriate location on your path.
